# firescale

This tool is a generic framework that is intended to be used for displaying automotive ECU parameters and fault codes. It contains no built-in support for diagnostic protocols; support for certain protocols is provided by external libraries. Information about ECU types and addresses/locations of parameters is provided in JSON configuration files. These configuration files also indicate the protocol that must be used to communicate with a particular ECU.
