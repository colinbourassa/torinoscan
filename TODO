Consider converting ECU definitions back to JSON, as this would allow the use of
nlohmann/json for JSON loading and parsing, and tristanpenman/valijson for validation
against a schema. Both of these libraries are available in header-only forms
to simplify build-time dependencies.

JSON supports only base-10 representation of numeric values, so this change would
require switching to string values for fields that are better represented in hex.
