At least one protocol (Marelli TCU) is capable of reading parameter data by
requesting a "value code", which is not a memory address and does not require
specifying a byte count. The ECU will apparently return the number of bytes
that are appropriate for the requested value, which is not consistent across
all values. We are identifying such parameters by using the JSON field named
"id" instead of "address".

Change the JSON to place snapshot data among the regular "parameters" section; just add a field named "snapshot" with the ID of the snapshot page. The "address" field can then be used as an offset within that page.
