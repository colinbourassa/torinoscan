      Original .txt file shows range as -2.050 to +2.050, but the SW seems to
      only accept values in the range [0x00,0x80] as valid, with them
      corresponding to the range [0.000,2.048].

      .TXT shows range as 0.000 to 2.000, but SW only ever seems to show values
      of 0.000 (for byte values 00-7F) or 1.000 (for byte values 80-FF).
