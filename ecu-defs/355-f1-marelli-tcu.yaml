    The Ferrari variant of this protocol has the following differences: (a)
    bytes 01-04 of the 0xAE reply are used as real data rather than just sync
    bytes; (b) snapshots contain 16 bytes rather than 10. TODO: Confirm which
    parameters require RAM read operations, and which 'value read' operations.
